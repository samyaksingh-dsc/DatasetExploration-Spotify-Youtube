# DatasetExploration-Spotify-Youtube
**Project Overview**

This project explores a dataset compiled from Spotify and YouTube, focusing on metrics such as track popularity, artist following, and audio feature analysis. The objective was to clean and analyze the data to extract meaningful insights about music trends and listener preferences.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and includes information on both Spotify and YouTube. 
Key metrics analyzed include:
•	Track popularity
•	Artist following
•	Audio features (danceability, energy, etc.)
•	YouTube views and likes
**Data Cleaning and Preparation**
To ensure data quality and consistency, several preprocessing steps were undertaken:
•	**Normalization:** Audio feature scales were normalized to maintain consistency.
•	**Standardization:** Track titles and artist names were standardized to ensure uniformity across platforms.
•	**Handling Missing Values:** Missing data, particularly in YouTube metrics, was carefully addressed to preserve the dataset's integrity.
**Methodology
Analysis Techniques**
The following quantitative analysis methods were employed:
•	**Descriptive Analysis:** Identified the most popular tracks and artists.
•	**Comparative Analysis:** Determined favorite artists across platforms.
•	**Correlation Analysis:** Explored relationships between Spotify audio features.
•	**Distribution Analysis:** Examined the spread of tracks across album types and artist popularity.
**Key Findings**
**1.	**Top Tracks Dominance:****
o	A small subset of tracks, such as Luis Fonsi's "Despacito," Wiz Khalifa's "See You Again," and Ed Sheeran's "Shape of You," dominate the total views, highlighting the 'hit-driven' nature of the industry.
**2.	Artist Popularity:**
o	BLACKPINK leads in aggregate likes, indicating strong fan engagement and the impact of visual content on YouTube.
**3.	Danceability and Energy Correlation:**
o	A positive correlation exists between danceability and energy, suggesting that tracks with higher energy tend to be more danceable and popular.
**4.	Album Type Distribution:**
o	Singles dominate the distribution of album types, reflecting industry trends in music dissemination.
**5.	YouTube Views Concentration:**
o	A few artists, such as BLACKPINK, Ed Sheeran, and Imagine Dragons, command a significant share of YouTube views, showcasing their global reach.
**Recommendations**
**•	Focus on Virality:** Production and marketing strategies should emphasize factors that drive potential virality.
**•	Engagement through Visuals:** Artists can enhance audience interaction by incorporating visual storytelling, as exemplified by BLACKPINK.
**•	Emphasize Danceability and Energy:** These attributes are key to attracting listener preferences and should be prioritized in track production.
**•	Strategic Release Calendar:** Maintaining a balance between album and single releases can optimize artist reach and engagement.
**Challenges**
**•	Data Consistency:** Ensuring consistency in track and artist names across platforms required extensive data cleaning.
**•	Handling Missing Values:** Careful consideration was given to the imputation and treatment of missing data to avoid skewing results.
**•	Data Aggregation:** Calculating average views and likes posed challenges due to the need for meaningful aggregation in context.
**Conclusion**
The exploration and visualization of the Spotify and YouTube music datasets provided valuable insights into music popularity dynamics and listener engagement. Strong business intelligence and analytical capabilities are crucial in navigating the complex digital music landscape. This research not only highlights current trends but also underscores the importance of data-driven decision-making in the creative and commercial sectors.
